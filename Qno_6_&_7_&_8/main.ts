6.	//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.
// Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name
// is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.


// Step 1: Store the name with whitespace characters at the beginning and end.
let personName: string = "\t\n   John Doe   \n\t";

// Step 2: Print the name with the whitespace characters displayed.
console.log("Original name with whitespaces:");
console.log(`"${personName}"`);

// Step 3: Strip the whitespace characters using the trim() method.
let strippedName: string = personName.trim();

// Step 4: Print the name after stripping the whitespaces.
console.log("Name after stripping whitespaces")
console.log(strippedName)










7.	//Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose
// your operations in print statements to see the results.


let operations = ["addition", "subtraction", "multiplication", "division"]



//addition of operators 
function sum(num1:number, num2:number){
    return num1 + num2
}

console.log(sum(2,6)) //8





//Subtraction of operator
let sub1 = 10
let sub2 = 2

let res = sub1 - sub2

console.log(res)




//multiplication of operators
let multiply = (dig1:number,dig2:number) => dig1  * dig2

console.log(multiply(2, 4))




//division of operators
let div1 = 16
let div2 = 2

let resul = div1 / div2

console.log(resul)












8. // You should create four lines that look like this:
//console.log(5 + 3)
//Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.

console.log(5 + 3);
console.log(16-8);
console.log(2*2*2)
console.log(16/2)
